        <h2>Hi.</h2>
        <p class="my-description">I'm a Computer Science Student at UFSCar. I am very passionate about solving real-world problems with the help of programming. Coding helps me to achieve things that I can imagine. To do it I am constantly gathering experience in the field of software development.</p>

          <h3>Solving Problems</h3>
          <p>One of my greatest passions is the art of solving problems. Absolutely nothing is more rewarding than being challenged and proving to me that I can go even further (just like the rocket on the home page). Identifying issues, analysing information, and providing solutions to real problems is something that I love to do. What I find intriguing is that complex but real problems can be solved just with my own thinking and great tools that I like to use, such as C/C++, C#, and Python.</p>

          <h3>Developing Software</h3>
          <p>In high school, I was introduced to the C language, worked on concepts of Boolean Algebra and some other tools like Arduino. At that time, I was completely amazed to see the power of simple software and how complex problems can be broken into simple parts. Nowadays, I am a developer, so I am constantly gathering experience in the field of software development. From that experience, I can say that I like to keep it simple. My goals are always to focus on clean and simple codes.</p>

          <h3>Competing</h3>
          <p>I am not saying that I necessarily like to compete with other people. Actually, this competitiveness applies mainly to me, I am constantly challenging myself and pushing my limits. Therefore, I really like everything that can improve my skills. This is not just intellectually, but very common in all instances of my life, every day I go to the gym to improve my body and mind, for example.</p>
